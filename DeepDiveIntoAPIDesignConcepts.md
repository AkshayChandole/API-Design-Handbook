## [What is API design?](#what-is-api-design)
API design is carefully planning, preparing, and developing programming interfaces (APIs) to expose data and the system’s functionality to consumers. APIs enable system-to-system communication and are essential for digital organizations because they add new capabilities to their products, operations, partnership strategies, and more. An effective API design is one that has satisfactory answers to the following queries of a developer:

Why is the API being developed?
- What would be the outcome regarding the impact and output of the system?
- How will the API be designed to meet the requirements?
- What will be the structure of our resources?
- How will we document our resources?

# [API design considerations](#api-design-considerations)
The following illustration shows the key points for better API design:

- Identify the potential users in terms of their relationship with the business (partners, customers, or external developers) for which API is being developed. This identification will define the level of access and type of authentication to be implemented in the API. The types of users will also help identify and implement the correct architectural style, REST, gRPC, and so on.
- Identify what developer problems are being solved in terms of their business relationship, critical needs, and value addition. Identifying the metrics that will improve after using the developed API is also necessary. These metrics include revenue, task speed, cost, and so on.
- It is important to identify the responses (successes or errors) to different API calls so that developers can understand the type and reason of the responses received from the server. Exception and error handling must be implemented along with well-defined endpoints of the API.
- Real-life use-case implementation should be applied so that the testability factor is checked and developers can understand the effectiveness of the designed API in terms of challenges and opportunities. While designing, we should analyze the performance of the API by testing different possible use cases.
- The API should be scalable to handle the increasing demands of customers. Therefore, the API’s design should consider scalability as an important factor in order to avoid fundamental modifications in the future.
- The API should be adequately documented so the developers can easily understand the integration, behaviors, structures, and parameters to be defined while using the API.
